# TSPGeneticAlgorithm
A genetic algorithm that solves Travelling Salesman Problem of 20 cities.
Since this project is suited to the needs of my IB Mathematics Extended Essay, visualization of the solution is not available, but the program outputs a list of numbers which are the measures of the performance of the algorithm.
Processing from processing.org and Java are used in this project.
